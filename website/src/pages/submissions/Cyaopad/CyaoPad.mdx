It am using it to test my EE knowledge

## Features:
- 128x32 OLED Display
- 4 WS2812B RGB LEDs. 
- 16 keys controlling the mouse
- choc keys

## CAD Model:
Everything fits together using 4 M3 Bolts

I used MX_V2 for the keyswitch footprints. I think in retrospect, I should've added a ground plane

## Firmware Overview
This hackpad uses kmk firmware for everything. 

I might add more in the future! That's it for now
