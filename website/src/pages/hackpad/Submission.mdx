# How to submit your project

Finally finished your hackpad? Nice job! Follow along and we're going to make sure you have everything necessary to *ship* your project, which includes:

- Structuring your project
- Exporting the production files
- Publishing the design


## Structuring your project
To make reviewing easier, we need to make sure that the source files of our project are formatted in a way that's complete & easy to navigate.

### 1) Make sure you have everything necessary:

Before we organize anything, make sure 
- A *complete* CAD model of the assembled case in .STEP or .3MF format
    - This should include the PCB (a blank rectangle is okay!) and all parts of the case
- Original firmware for your macropad. QMK, KMK, ZMK, etc derivatives are valid
- A complete BOM (Bill of Materials) with all the parts you would like in a separate markdown document!

Additionally, make sure you meet the following requirements:
- Your design uses a through-hole Seeed XIAO RP2040 as the main MCU
- Your PCB is smaller or equal to 100mmx100mm
- Your case fits within 200x200x100mm (x / y / z)
- You have less than 16 inputs (switches, encoders, etc)
- You are using approved parts only
- The PCB only uses 2 layers
- Your case only has 3D printed parts

If you have all of that, it should be ready to go!

### 2) Organize your folders
The above is a LOT of files! To make reviewing as easy as possible, your submission format should have 3 folders:
- pcb
- firmware
- CAD

Put each part of your design in their correspoding folders.

## Creating production files
Nice job on organizing your files! Next, we need to create the manufacturing files that will actually be used to build your project.

This is separate from the source files, which are usually a reference to check out & iterate on your design.

### 1) Export your PCB
Depending on your tool of choice, the exact workflow will be different. What you want to do is export your PCB as a set of files called Gerbers, which are basically instructions for the
 manufacturer to build your PCB. it should be compressed into a .zip file.

The internet will help you out on this one. The end file you get should be named gerbers.zip and contain all the production files in it.

### 2) Export your Case parts
Each individual part of the case should be exported into its respective files:
- If the part is 3D printed, it should be exported into STL 
- If it's going to be laser cut, it should be exported as a DXF

Put it inside a folder called "case"

### 3) Compile your firmware
This step is going to depend on what you used specifically, but the resulting file should be named firmware.uf2

What you want to search for is how to compile firmware for an rp2040. Good luck!

### 4) Organize it all
Now that you've made all the production files, create a new folder called production and put all the files in there.

## Publishing your project
The final step to making your PR is to actually publish your project! This involves writing a simple page for it explaining what it is.

You can put absolutely *anything* on it, as it's your page. I recommend talking about:

- What was your inspiration to make it?
- Hardest challenges faced
- Other fun facts to know

Every hackpad submission's page will be published on the main hackpad website, so make sure to go submit!

## Make a PR 
First, double check your submission against the [Orpheuspad](https://github.com/hackclub/hackpad/tree/main/hackpads/orpheuspad) example to make sure you have the correct structure. Everything should match exactly, except for the filenames.

If anything is unclear, make sure to ask in #hackpad!

Once everything is organized, you can make a PR to the repository [here](https://github.com/hackclub/hackpad)!

## After submitting
If everything went correctly, your PR will be reviewed (and hopefully approved!) by @alexren. If it's approved, then you'll get:
- All of your parts from the approved list
- A soldering iron
- A $20 grant for your PCB + custom components
- Your 3D printed case

For many of you, the firmware may not work the first try. That's okay! Keep working at it until it's fixed; if you send a video in #hackpad showing it working, I'll ship you a free custom hack-club keycap and sticker!
